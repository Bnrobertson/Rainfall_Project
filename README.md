## Data Source
We will utilize historical weather data from the following reputable sources:

Weather Underground: Monthly weather history data from Weather Underground 
(https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/nc/morrisville/KRDU/date/2024-5).

Meteostat: Historical weather data formatted according to Meteostat standards (https://dev.meteostat.net/python/#installation).

The data will span 23 years to ensure a comprehensive analysis. We will validate the data by cross-referencing with other local weather stations and official meteorological records to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Usage

To recreate the analysis:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
In PostgreSQL, create a database entitled "Rainfall"
Within the "Rainfall_project" database, use the Rain_no_rain.sql file to create a table named Rainfall
Import the  file to the "" table just created in PostgreSQL
